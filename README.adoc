Solutions for exercises in _The C Programming Language, Second Edition_.

== Requirements

* https://cmake.org[CMake] (3.12.x)
* https://www.python.org[Python] (3.x)
* A compiler like https://gcc.gnu.org[GNU `gcc`] or https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp[Microsoft `cl`].

== Building

Create a directory for the out of source build

```
mkdir build
cd build
```

then generate the build scripts.

=== Unix

```
cmake -G 'Unix Makefiles' ..
make
ctest
```

=== Windows

cmake -G 'Visual Studio 15 2017' ..
msbuild all_build.vcxproj
msbuild run_tests.vcxproj
```

For setting up the necessary enviroment to be able to use MSBuild
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?view=vs-2017[follow this article].
Basically search for _Developer Command Prompt for VS 2017_ in the Windows menu, start it.
It'll setup the correct `PATH` so that MSBuild could be invoked easily.
