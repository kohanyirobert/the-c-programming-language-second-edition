= Exercise 1-2

* Unknown escape sequences raise a waring during compilation.
  Such sequences are
** `\8` and `\9`
** `\c` and `\d`
** `\e` (only when compiled with `cl`)
** from `\g` up to `\m`
** `\o`, `\p` and `\q`
** `\s`
** `\w`, `\y` and `\z`.
* `\0` signals the end of a string as such `printf` only prints a string
  argument up to this character and discards the rest.
  Also it signifies the start of octal integer constant.
* `\u` cannot be used alone as an escape character because it used to specify
  universal character names.
  The compile looks for more characters after `\u`.
  When it doesn't find any the compilation fails.
* `\x` is used to specify hexadecimal numbers.
  When the compiler founds this escape sequence without following hex digits
  the compilation fails.
* Well-known escape sequences like `\a`, `\f`, `\n`, `\r`, etc. are
