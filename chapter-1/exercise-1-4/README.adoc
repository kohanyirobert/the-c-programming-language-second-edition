= Exercise 1-4

* `celsius` can be declared as an `int`.
  When it's a `float` warnings maybe raised by some compilers about
  possible conversion errors.
* `celsius` can be incremented terser with the `+=` operator.
* Important to note that there's no such thing as an `=+` operator, it's
  parsed as two separate things, `=` (assignment), then `+` (unary plus).
