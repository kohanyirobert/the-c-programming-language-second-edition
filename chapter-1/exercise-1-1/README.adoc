= Exercise 1-1

* Removing `#include <stdio.h>` results in compiler warnings, because it
  notices that we're using `printf` like if it was a built-in function, but
  it's not.
* Leaving out the `\n` after the `hello, world` string ends up not printing a
  newline to the terminal when the program runs.
* Removing the `main` function name, the parenthesis after the function name,
  the semi-colon after the `printf` function call, either `"` (double-quotes),
  etc. all result in compilation error.
